This is the heart of the BBC generation system it takes the following inputs
*raw files TODO change to R.*
These files are in the format 
<Publisher> <Description> <Filename> <Execution type> <Page> <disk> <generic program type> <favorate>
These are each text tab seperated with the record being return terminated
<Publisher> and <Description> are not length limited (be sensible) note that it is assumed that <publisher> will repeat so you need to ensure that data quality is good
<filename> is of the form x.xxxxxxx if no prefix a $ is assumed
<execution> is one of erlc meaning execute (as in EXEC !boot) R meaning *RUN "x.xxxxxxx" L meaning load is normally indicates a ROM  C meaning chain"x.xxxxxxx"
<PAGE> a two character indicator of Page i.e. 0E is page = &0E00 this should not be nessasary any longer as file info has been changed on the collections i have scrubbed
<generic program type> one of acgsmpuz A text adventure C cheat G Arcade game S Strategy M music U unknown Z utils
<favorate> Y yes

Output files 
H software publishing houses 1-1027 note padded if to avoid null records 
D disknumber to title mapping 0-510 note padded if to avoid null records 
CatDatx a number of Catalogue files containing the converted raw files.  Number of CatDatx files depends on the the size of the raw files this starts @ catdat1 and is inremented in ASCII


CatDat consists of
variable file description coverted into lower 127 char range teminated by MSB being set
4 bytes containing disk no pub number fav game type and catalogue number


Thus to extract record from start of file read characters until MSB is 1 this is the file description and the next four bytes have index and data

file is null terminated

in order to generate files a basic program p.process and a corisponding M/C MnuHelp is used (source in p.mnuhelp).  
NB ANY CHANGE TO P.MNUHELP WILL REQUIRE CALL ADDRESSES TO BE ALTERED IN P.PROCESS

this will generate DINREC and PUBDAT - (the latter can be put in alphabetical order)
