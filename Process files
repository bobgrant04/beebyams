This is the heart of the BBC generation system it takes the following inputs
*raw files TODO change to R.*
These files are in the format 
<Publisher> <Description> <Filename> <Execution type> <Page> <disk> <generic program type> <favorate>
These are each text tab seperated with the record being return terminated
<Publisher> and <Description> are not length limited (be sensible) note that it is assumed that <publisher> will repeat so you need to ensure that data quality is good
<filename> is of the form x.xxxxxxx if no prefix a $ is assumed
<execution> is one of erlc meaning execute (as in EXEC !boot) R meaning *RUN "x.xxxxxxx" L meaning load is normally indicates a ROM  C meaning chain"x.xxxxxxx"
<PAGE> a two character indicator of Page i.e. 0E is page = &0E00 this should not be nessasary any longer as file info has been changed on the collections i have scrubbed
<generic program type> one of acgsmpuz A text adventure C cheat G Arcade game S Strategy M music U unknown Z utils
<favorate> Y yes
