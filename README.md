BBC model B mmc Menu system
This project attempts to build on the mmc dfs (disk filing system) that allows owners of BBC micros and emulators to have up to 510 disk images available for mounting virtually from the command line.
With this flexabilty comes the problem of using the system for a games system allowing for rapid selection of a game or program.
The Stairway to Hell archive had a good solution with their menu system however a number of changes will enable other collections to be added.  With this in mind a number of processes and programs will generate the required files to allow a more generic menu system
