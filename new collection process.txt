In order to create a new collection

create a new beeb.mmb

add mmcmenu,process,rawdat
type *magic on disk process to see  supported special file types use these with S and last last hex byte

add required disks

optional rename disks using p.dinren on process this is good as makes a collection easily identifiable and prevents name clashes

take any of the existing $.XXX.csv files
use as a template 

select the first disk - look at !boot to see the structure
record the files into csv file
repeat until complete

save csv AS A TAB DELIMINATED FILE (sorry to shout!)

add newly created file to raw.dat

run p.processs on disk process with newly created csv using the 'V' option -this will ensure that you have a clean data set
correct CSV file as required (i.e. - or _)

run p.process on disk process with newly created csv using the 'M' option 
run p.process on disk process with newly created csv using the 'MF' option to force use of csv details (will ask for each one)
