In order to create a new collection

create a new beeb.mmb

add mmcmenu,process,rawdat
type *magic on disk process to see  supported special file types use these with S and last last hex byte

add required disks

optional rename disks using p.dinren on process this is good as makes a collection easily identifiable and prevents name clashes

take any of the existing $.XXX.csv files
use as a template 

select the first disk - look at !boot to see the structure
record the files into csv file
repeat until complete

save csv AS A TAB DELIMINATED FILE (sorry to shout!)

add newly created file to raw.dat

run p.Sfile 
run p.Ifile 
run p.out
